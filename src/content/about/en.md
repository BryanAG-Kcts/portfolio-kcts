Hello! I'm **Bryan David √Ålvarez Galvis**, a student about to complete my **Systems Engineering degree at UFPSO** (Oca√±a, Colombia).

I love everything related to the **JavaScript** ecosystem, especially the visual aspect, because I enjoy creating interactive and enjoyable interfaces. _I'm so glad you've made it this far and are reading this right now üôå_. I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio as much as I enjoyed creating it.

If you'd like to learn more about my academic and professional career, I invite you to **check out my resume**. I've had the opportunity to work on projects that go beyond programming; _not everything is code._
